## Setup

### Use the Extension

To use the extension without editing it, download the Chrome extension [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/qr-code-generator/enjcphliddmdkmgolkmkkkdnldidhgml?hl=en-GB&authuser=0).

### Edit the Code
To edit this code and customize it yourself, the latest build on Chrome can be downloaded from [releases](https://github.com/Alex0Blackwell/qr-code-extension/releases "Go to releases").  

Here the file can be unzipped and added to chrome by:

    Chrome: Extensions > Load unpacked > "load unzipped folder"

Now the QR-Code Converter will run the downloaded version and it may be edited.

## Limitations
- QR-Codes can only represent text.
- The amount of text that can be represented by a QR-Code is limited by the size of the QR-Code itself *(1056 characters in this case)*.
